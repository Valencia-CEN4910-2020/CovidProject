# Covid Tracker

Covid Tracker was built to respond to IBM's Call for Code Challenge as part of our summer 2020 Senior Design project at Valencia College. Covid Tracker displays unbiased COVID-19 statistics for the state of Florida, but can be easily expanded to include other states and countries. 

What sets Covid Tracker apart from the rest of the COVID dashboards is it compares actual infection rates against the original projected rates.

This Project is built using CoreUI's Free react Admin Template V2! https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-react-admin-template

## Versions

This is the original version that displays Florida statistics only.

## Installation

COVID Tracker is based on Core UI's React admin package. If you're cloning the code to run on your local machine, please ensure you have the latest version of NodeJS, ReactJS, and npm installed on your machine. You may view directions on installing NodeJS/npm here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm and ReactJS here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_environment_setup.htm

Once the repository is cloned and the packages are installed, open a terminal or PowerShell Window in the root folder of the cloned Github repository and type **npm start** to run the COVID Tracker web application.

## Usage

The web page is easy to use. Without installing anything, you may visit https://flcovidtracker.firebaseapp.com/#/ to access the currently hosted web app. Simply click on a Florida county to repopulate the graphs with that county's COVID statistics.

If you have the program installed, running the **npm start** command in a terminal will load the web application in a new browser window.

## Documentation

The basic user manual for the Covid Tracker application can be found on the repository: https://github.com/Valencia-CEN4910-2020/CovidProject/blob/master/User%20Manual.docx

The JavaScript documentation for the COVID Tracker application can be found on the repository: https://github.com/Valencia-CEN4910-2020/CovidProject/tree/master/src/CovidTracker_JSDocs

The documentation for the CoreUI  Admin Template is hosted at the CoreUi website: [CoreUI for React](https://coreui.io/react/)

## Limitations

Florida does not currently publish statistics on people who have recovered from COVID-19, so recovery counts have not been included.
