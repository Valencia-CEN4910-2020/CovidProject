# Covid Tracker

Covid Tracker was built to respond to IBM's Call for Code Challenge as part of our Senior Design project at Valencia College. Covid Tracker was built to display unbiased COVID-19 statistics for the state of Florida, but can be easily expanded to include other states and countries. 

What sets Covid Tracker apart from the rest of the COVID dashboards is it compares actual infection rates against the original projected rates.

This Project is built using CoreUI's Free react Admin Template V2! https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-react-admin-template

There is only one limitation you can't can’t re-distribute the CoreUI as stock. You can’t do this if you modify the CoreUI. In past we faced some problems with persons who tried to sell CoreUI based templates.
